_s_starter
===

Hi. I'm a collection of files used to kickstart development when using the [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s/) theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:

* A structured LESS stylesheet using partials organized using a variation on the 7â€“1 pattern
* A site JavaScript file with a better viewport units function and a external links function
* Artwork templates (for Illustrator and Photoshop) with artboards sized to create a favicon, open graph image, and theme screenshot

Installation
---------------

### Quick Start

Copy this repositories files into a underscores theme folder (using [their generator](https://underscores.me/)). Skip overwriting the `READEME.md` file, but merge the contents of the `js` folders.
